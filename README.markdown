A BBEdit package to make working with HTML easier
===================================================

People have been writing HTML with BBEdit since the inception of HTML itself.

The package gathers up some gems from the community (for example: JS Lint integration for BBEdit) and packages it all together, along with some scripts I (Ryan Wilcox) and others wrote and/or ported.

Installation
============

    $ cd Library/Application\ Support/BBEdit/
    $ mkdir Packages                            # if it doesn't already exists
    $ cd Packages
    $ git clone https://github.com/rwilcox/html.bbpackage.git

And restart BBEdit.

The JS Lint script requires jsl to be in `/opt/local/bin/jsl`. To install this via Macports:

  `sudo port install javascript-lint`.

(Yes, I know I'm showing my Macports bias.)


Have a useful thing to contribute?
=============================

Please do! I'm sure you HTML developers/designers have great scripts and text filters the community would like to use too. I don't write pure HTML much, so I'd love to see more tools from people who make their livings writing HTML in BBEdit.
